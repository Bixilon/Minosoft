# Development

Generally I'd say TBA, but some basic rules are here. Feel free to contact us first, before developing huge things. May be better.
Also, (before someone asks): I don't care if you use Kotlin or Java.


## Git Rules

- Small Features in `development`.
- `master` must always be stable and functional.
- No force pushes (or modifying the git history) in protected branches (aka. `master`).
- Bigger features on own branches. Merge only via Merge Request.
- No commits directly in `master`

## Git access
 - Don't just request developer access, I'll not just give you access, instead create a fork, and a pull requests, we will accept (or decline) it. Probably a bit of discussion.
 - If you develop here for a while, you can request developer access, and I'll contact it. But probably you won't need it, but I'll probably don't refuse to give it to you.
