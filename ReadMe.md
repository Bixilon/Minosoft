There is no such this as "reverse developering". That is the ```stupidest``` and most pathetic lie ever. Stop being disrespectful & insulting to developering and developers. You wannabe losers hijacked the great words "developer" and "developering", and started applying it to the most random, stupid and irrelevant subjects. You know nothing about what developering entails. developering means designing, building and producing real MECHANICAL systems, like turbojets and vehicular engines. You know nothing about what developering entails. It has nothing to do with clowns sitting behind a keyboard and decoding/programming/deciphering etc. 
```cpp
Software dev is easy and for kids. And it has absolutely nothing to do with a serious and real subject like developering
```
(Mechanical developering is the ONLY developering). Quit making false claims against developering you. And stop being disrespectful to real developers.(Mechanical developering is the ONLY developering). Quit making false claims against developering you. And stop being disrespectful to real developers. and most pathetic lie ever. Stop being disrespectful & insulting to developering and developers
